# Conditionals
a conditional is a way to perform different actions based on whether a certain condition is true or false. 
It allows the program to make decisions.

simple breakdown:
- Condition: A statement that can be true or false (e.g., "Is the number greater than 10?").
- If Statement: A common way to implement conditionals. 
    If the condition is true, the program executes a specific block of code. 
    If it's false, it may execute a different block or do nothing.
    e.g
    if the number is greater than 10 then
        print "The number is large"
    else
        print "The number is small"
