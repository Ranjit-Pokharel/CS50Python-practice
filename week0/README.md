# Functions and Variables

## Variables
a variable is a way to store data or information so that you can use it later. 
Think of a variable like a box with a label on it, where you can put something 
(like a number, word, or other data) and then refer to it by its name.

### Here’s a simple breakdown:
- A variable name is like the label on the box.
- The value is what you store inside the box.
- The type of the variable refers to what kind of thing is inside (like a number, text, etc.).

## Functions
In programming, a function is like a mini-program inside your program. 
It takes some input, does something with it (like a calculation or action), 
and then gives you an output.

### Think of it like a recipe:
- The ingredients you give to the recipe are the inputs (called arguments or parameters).
- The steps in the recipe are the code inside the function.
- The finished dish is the output (called the return value).

Once you write a function, 
you can use it anytime without rewriting the code. 
This makes programs easier to understand and saves time!

## Bugs
bugs are mistakes or errors in the code that cause a program to behave unexpectedly or incorrectly. 
They can prevent a program from working properly, crashing it, giving wrong results, or making it run slower.

### Bugs can happen for many reasons, such as:
- Typos: Writing the wrong code by accident.
- Logic errors: When the code works, but it doesn't do what you intended.
- Missing steps: Forgetting to include necessary instructions.
- Wrong assumptions: Assuming something about the data or environment that isn’t true.

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing these bugs to make the program work correctly.
