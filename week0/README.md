# Functions and Variables
## Functions
In programming, a function is like a mini-program inside your program. 
It takes some input, does something with it (like a calculation or action), 
and then gives you an output.
### Think of it like a recipe:
- The ingredients you give to the recipe are the inputs (called arguments or parameters).
- The steps in the recipe are the code inside the function.
- The finished dish is the output (called the return value).
Once you write a function, 
you can use it anytime without rewriting the code. 
This makes programs easier to understand and saves time!
## Bugs
bugs are mistakes or errors in the code that cause a program to behave unexpectedly or incorrectly. 
They can prevent a program from working properly, crashing it, giving wrong results, or making it run slower.

### Bugs can happen for many reasons, such as:
- Typos: Writing the wrong code by accident.
- Logic errors: When the code works, but it doesn't do what you intended.
- Missing steps: Forgetting to include necessary instructions.
- Wrong assumptions: Assuming something about the data or environment that isnâ€™t true.
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing these bugs to make the program work correctly.
